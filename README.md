# Universal Clock Field Theory (UCFT)
The official repository for Universal Clock Field Theory (UCFT).

## Introduction

### What is UCFT?
TODO: describe at a high conceptual level what UCFT is.

### Why UCFT?
TODO: UCFT's elegance vs. string theory primarily.

## Repository

### Structure
TODO: outline what each folder in this repo is.

## Quick Start

### Foundations
TODO: quick start if you are a mathematical physicist or you are a theoretical physicist interested in UCFT's core mathematical foundations. i.e. where to find in papers, code working out foundations, etc.

### Theoretical Physics
TODO: quick start if you are a theoretical physicist and are interested in how
the foundations of UCFT gives rise to SM, spacetime, and gravity. i.e. where to in the papers, code that calculates theoretical results, etc.

### Experimental & Numerical Physics
TODO: quick start if you are looking for how to reproduce UCFT results or make UCFT-specific predictions. ie. point to code files, papers on experimental considerations, etc.

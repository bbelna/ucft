Below is a concise but comprehensive list of **Low-Energy Boundary Conditions** (experimental inputs at or near the electroweak scale) and **Mass Spectrum Assumptions** (high-scale thresholds for GUT states) that you can use to implement your full numerical RG running for the UCFT model. These are the essential ingredients to move from theory into a piecewise integration of the RGEs from low to high scales and back.

## 1. Low-Energy (Electroweak Scale) Boundary Conditions

At the scale \(\mu = m_Z \approx 91.1876\)\,GeV, the following are well-measured Standard Model (SM) inputs (in the \(\overline{\text{MS}}\) scheme, typically):

1. **Electromagnetic Coupling**  
   \[
   \alpha_{\mathrm{em}}^{-1}(m_Z) \;\approx\; 127.94 
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   \alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(m_Z) \;\approx\; 1/127.94.
   \]
   (Sometimes people use slightly different reference values ~1/127.955, but the difference is minor.)

2. **Weak Mixing Angle**  
   \[
   \sin^2 \theta_W(m_Z) \;\approx\; 0.2312 \quad (\text{in } \overline{\text{MS}}).
   \]
   This determines \(\alpha_2(m_Z)\) and \(\alpha_1(m_Z)\) (given the hypercharge normalization). Concretely:
   \[
   \alpha_2(m_Z) 
   \;=\; \frac{\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(m_Z)}{\sin^2 \theta_W(m_Z)},
   \quad
   \alpha_1(m_Z) 
   \;=\; \frac{\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(m_Z)}{\cos^2 \theta_W(m_Z)} \cdot \frac{5}{3},
   \]
   where the factor \(\tfrac{5}{3}\) comes from the usual SU(5) GUT hypercharge normalization.

3. **Strong Coupling**  
   \[
   \alpha_3(m_Z) \;\approx\; 0.118 \;\;\; (\text{with } \Delta\alpha_3 \approx 0.001\text{ to }0.002).
   \]

4. **Yukawa Couplings**  
   If you want to incorporate fermion masses and mixings (especially top, bottom, \(\tau\)), you need the running \(\overline{\text{MS}}\) masses or equivalently the Yukawa couplings at \(m_Z\). For a basic 1- or 2-loop analysis, often only the top Yukawa \(y_t\) is critical. A representative value:
   \[
   y_t(m_t) \;\approx\; 0.93\text{--}0.95,
   \quad
   \text{or }
   y_t(m_Z) \approx 0.99,
   \]
   depending on the scheme used. Similar data can be used for \(y_b(m_Z), y_\tau(m_Z)\), etc., if desired.

5. **Higgs Self-Coupling**  
   If your model fully merges with the SM at low scales, you may incorporate the SM Higgs quartic \(\lambda_H\) at \(m_Z\) (e.g.\ \(\lambda_H \approx 0.128\)). However, in a unified scenario with additional scalar multiplets, you often treat the low-energy SM-like \(\lambda_H\) as a matching condition from your GUT Higgs sector. So whether you do so or not depends on how you handle threshold decoupling for the heavy states.

## 2. Mass Spectrum Assumptions (High-Scale Thresholds)

In the UCFT + SU(5) context, you have several superheavy states that decouple at or near the GUT scale:

1. **GUT Gauge Bosons (\(X,Y\))**  
   - Typically \(M_{X,Y} \approx g_5\,v\), where \(v \sim 10^{15\text{--}16}\)\,GeV is the SU(5)-breaking VEV of the clock field \(\Phi\).  
   - In many minimal SU(5) scenarios, \(M_{X,Y}\) sets the GUT scale around \(10^{16}\)\,GeV, though it can be closer to \(10^{15}\)\,GeV if the clock field or threshold corrections shift the precise unification scale.

2. **Color-Triplet Higgs (\(\mathbf{3},\overline{\mathbf{3}}\))**  
   - Via the missing-partner mechanism (MPM), these components of \(H(\mathbf{5})\) and \(\bar{H}(\mathbf{\overline{5}})\) typically get mass near \(M_{\mathrm{GUT}}\) or slightly below.  
   - You might assume \(M_{T} \approx \kappa\,v\), for some coupling \(\kappa\) (a combination of \(\lambda_{1,2}\) and the \(\Sigma\)-induced terms).

3. **Adjoint Clock Field \(\Phi(\mathbf{24})\) Heavy Components**  
   - Most components of the adjoint are heavy, with \(M_{\Phi} \sim \sqrt{\lambda_\Phi}\,v\).  
   - A few might remain massless (would-be Goldstone modes or zero modes if the potential includes special couplings) but typically you place them at or near \(M_{\mathrm{GUT}}\).

4. **\(\mathbf{50}\)-Dimensional Higgs \(\Sigma\)**  
   - Introduced by the MPM. Its mass scale is likewise \(\mathcal{O}(v)\). Specific couplings determine \(M_{\Sigma}\). Usually set equal or slightly above the GUT scale for convenience.

5. **Optional Right-Handed Neutrinos**  
   - If included, you set \(M_{N_R} \approx 10^{10\text{--}14}\)\,GeV for seesaw, or tie it to GUT-scale thresholds if you prefer.

### Recommended Approach for your RG Simulation

1. **Pick** or **scan** a range of input parameters:
   - \(v\) (the clock-field VEV) or equivalently \(M_{\mathrm{GUT}}\).
   - The dimensionless couplings \(\lambda_{1,2}\), \(\lambda_\Phi\), or combinations that fix mass ratios among heavy multiplets.

2. **Define** threshold crossing scales:
   - For instance, if \(M_{X,Y} = 10^{16}\)\,GeV, you track what \(\mu\) you cross that threshold at, apply \(\Delta_i\).
   - Then do similarly for the color-triplet, \(\mathbf{50}\) Higgs, and adjoint components.

3. **Implement** piecewise RG:
   - Start from \(\mu \approx m_Z\) with the low-energy boundary conditions (couplings).  
   - Integrate up to each threshold. At each threshold, apply \(\alpha_i^{-1}(M_{\mathrm{th}}^-)=\alpha_i^{-1}(M_{\mathrm{th}}^+)+\Delta_i\). Continue to the next threshold.  
   - You eventually arrive at the highest scale, possibly \(> 10^{16}\)\,GeV, checking for unification or an asymptotically safe fixed point.

4. **Check** for:
   - Gauge coupling unification (\(\alpha_1 \approx \alpha_2 \approx \alpha_3\) within a small tolerance) near your chosen \(M_{\mathrm{GUT}}\).  
   - Behavior of the clock fieldâ€™s quartic \(\lambda_\Phi\). If it runs into a Landau pole below the Planck scale, the model may not be consistent. If it remains finite and flows to a UV fixed point, that supports asymptotic safety.

## 3. Special Notes / Caveats

1. **Non-Minimal Threshold Tuning**  
   - The actual GUT scale can shift if threshold corrections are large or if couplings (like \(\lambda_{2}\) in the missing-partner sector) are big. 
   - Sometimes a small amount of fine-tuning or a well-chosen set of couplings is needed to get precise unification at \(10^{16}\)\,GeV.

2. **Neutrino Sector**  
   - If you want a seesaw mechanism, you need to decide where \(N_R\) sits.  
   - If \(M_{N_R} \ll M_{\mathrm{GUT}}\), youâ€™ll have an additional threshold around \(10^{10\text{--}14}\)\,GeV that slightly modifies \(\alpha_1\) and possibly \(\alpha_2, \alpha_3\) depending on the SM embedding.

3. **Large Yukawa Couplings**  
   - The top quarkâ€™s Yukawa can be significant enough to influence the gauge running, especially if you do a 2-loop analysis. You might incorporate that if you want a more accurate result.

4. **SUSY or Not**  
   - If your UCFT approach eventually merges with a supersymmetric GUT, your boundary conditions differ (the MSSM couplings at the TeV scale, etc.). For the non-SUSY route, your current approach is consistent.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Conclusion**
You now have:
- **Low-energy SM boundary conditions** at \(m_Z\).  
- **Mass spectrum assumptions** for the GUT-scale states in the clock field, \(\Sigma\), color-triplet Higgs, and \(X,Y\) gauge bosons.

With these in hand, you can:
1. Set up piecewise integration for your RGEs (1-loop or 2-loop).
2. **Numerically** check unification or emergent phenomena (asymptotic safety, gravitational coupling induction).
3. Adjust or scan over your free parameters (\(\lambda\) couplings, VEV scales) to see how robust your predictions are.

Once you have the numeric code set up (e.g., Python or Mathematica), youâ€™ll be able to produce plots of \(\alpha_i(\mu)\) vs. \(\mu\), track the flow of \(\lambda_\Phi\), and verify the GUT-scale consistency of the UCFT scenario.
